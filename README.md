- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies

### State Management
The chatbot uses a state machine approach with the following states:
- `INITIAL`: Starting state
- `ADMISSION_INTEREST`: Checking admission interest
- `BIOLOGY_CHECK`: Verifying Biology eligibility
- `PROGRAM_DETAILS`: Providing program information
- `FEE_STRUCTURE`: Explaining fee structure
- `HOSTEL_FACILITIES`: Describing hostel facilities
- `COLLEGE_LOCATION`: Providing location information
- `RECOGNITION`: Explaining recognition
- `CLINICAL_TRAINING`: Describing training locations
- `SCHOLARSHIP`: Providing scholarship information
- `TOTAL_SEATS`: Informing about available seats
- `ELIGIBILITY`: Explaining eligibility criteria
- `END`: Conversation end

### Response Detection
- **Positive Patterns**: Recognizes "haan", "yes", "batao", "tell me", etc.
- **Negative Patterns**: Recognizes "nahi", "no", "not interested", etc.
- **Fallback**: Asks for clarification if response is unclear

### Styling Changes
Modify the CSS in `templates/index.html` to change the appearance.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port already in use**: Change port in `app.py` line 28
2. **Dependencies not installed**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Template not found**: Ensure `templates` folder exists
4. **Import errors**: Check Python version compatibility

### Debug Mode
